to install git we use
	1- apt install git -y (this is for linux)
	
to downlode a reprository from git to any particular system
	git clone url		(for pasing we can use shift+ctrl+v)
		url = https://github.com/MdMotahir/Backend-Part
	ex - git clone https://github.com/MdMotahir/Backend-Part

if i use ls -a then we get all file and directory. if that is hidden then that also seen.
		hidden directory always start with '.'.

to get last change in repisoratory
	git log
	after useing git log we get a commit id
		then we use that particular id to know more about that.
	git show commi_id
	ex- git show 05a70552f13c1eb371ac42915fc5ff68c0903a87
	
	for geting ou from that part we use 'q'.

to add my folder or file to a repisoratory
	git init
	git add file_name	(this is only for adding one file)
		or
	git add .
	
	git config --global user.email "mdmotahiralam@gmail.com"
	git config --global user.name "MdMotahir"
	
	git commit -m "My First Commit" (This is my comit msg)
	
	git remote add origin https://github.com/MdMotahir/LearningGit.git	(here the url for my repository)
	
	git push -u origin master	(Done)


we have a comand git status which so the status of current directory.
	basically if that is not in your repositotry then shown.
	(git status)

to rename a file then we use
	mv old_file_name new_file_name	(mv new.py today.py)
	git status
	git add .
	git status
	git commit -m "msg"
	git push	(Done)


to ge about a paricular version in our commit 
	we go to commit section
	then copy that commit id
	then we use
		git checkout commit_id	(git checkout d5dd797d50bf7ecf8fb93ab1bd07855f1a4da175)
	then ls
	we go older version file. (done)

for short cut we use git commit -am "msg"
	this is only for old file ehich is alreadu in repository
	here -a means add
		and m for comit part

for cheack about branch we use
	git branch -a
for creat a branch we use
	git branch name (git branch dev-edyoda)
for uptudate the branches we use
	git pull origin master
for change the branch we use
	git checkout branch_name 	(git checkout dev-edyoda)
for check it we use =
	git branch -a
		here we get a star mark before that particular branch

after changing branch we play with code then after commit and push we get our 2 branch with their respective code
	one is master branch where older or main code is present
	2nd one is our new branch where we use save code after changing that.

if we use git pull origin dev-edyoda
	then we marge this code with master code.
	then we use git push
		after that we see that in github
